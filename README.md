Hello! 
This is my first 2D game. One of the pong genre which you might notice. As this is my first game it will most likely not be the best but I 
choose to publish it publicly in the case of anyone waning to test it out and report any issues found or just give me any tips on what I could improve in the code.

Keybinds:                                                                
  Menu:                                                           
    [Space] Start the game                                                               
                                                      
  Game:                                                            
    [W] Move player paddle up(blue) {Only if both paddles are not controlled by the program}                               
    [S] Move player paddle down(blue) {Only if both paddles are not controlled by the program}                                           
    [Escape] Exit to main menu                                                                          
    [Arrow-Key Right] Increase speed of ball                                       
    [Arrow-Key Left] Decrease speed of ball
